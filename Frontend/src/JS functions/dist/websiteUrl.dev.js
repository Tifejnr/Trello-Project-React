"\nHi Robert,  I am a sales/outreach newbie who is willing to get experience and coaching from people already in the marketing business. I have gone through some of your materials, I am familiar with some of the ethics already as I have been learning about outreach / sales / closing online.  \n\nI've attached my score on the test below.\n\nWould appreciate if you could give me a chance to work with you on this. \n\nAlways happy to help.\n\n-Adedewe\n\n\n";
