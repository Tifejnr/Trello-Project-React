                <h3>Real Time Saving Impact</h3>
                <p>
                  Collab for Trello can save you significant time managing
                  Trello memberships.
                </p>

                <p>
                  For example, if manually removing a member from 10 different
                  boards takes 70 seconds (assuming each board removal takes 7
                  seconds).
                </p>

                <p>
                  Collab for Trello tools do the same in just 2.5 seconds (each
                  member removal takes about 0.25 seconds). That's a time
                  savings of about 95%!
